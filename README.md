# CCI Project

This repository contains various coding challenges and implementations of different algorithms and data structures, primarily using C++ and Python. The focus is on competitive programming and improving algorithmic skills through practice and problem-solving.

## Project Structure

- **BinarySearch/**: Contains implementations of binary search algorithms.
- **CCI/**: Contains solutions to coding challenges from the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book.
- **test/**: Directory for test cases and additional scripts.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DhairyaKarna/CCI.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd CCI
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the respective directories (e.g., `BinarySearch`, `CCI`) to find specific implementations and solutions.
2. Compile and run the C++ files using a compiler like `g++`:
    ```sh
    g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
    ./output_file
    ```
3. For Python scripts, run them using Python:
    ```sh
    python script_name.py
    ```
